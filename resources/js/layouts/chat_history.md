# Chat History Summary

*   **User's Goal:** Rebuild a static website for their father into a modern, beautiful, and dynamic web application using Laravel and Vue.js.
*   **My Persona:** A senior Laravel Vue Full Stack Developer, expert in Vue-Bits, GSAP, and AI integration.
*   **Initial Analysis:**
    *   The user provided images of the old website, logos, and portfolio pictures located in the `public/images` directory.
    *   We faced a workspace restriction that initially limited my access to the `resources/js/layouts` directory.
*   **The Plan:**
    *   Create a component-based architecture using Vue.js.
    *   Use Vue-Bits for UI components and GSAP for animations.
    *   Use Laravel for the backend to manage dynamic content.
    *   The homepage will be composed of the following components: `Header.vue`, `Hero.vue`, `Services.vue`, `Portfolio.vue`, `Contact.vue`, and `Footer.vue`.
*   **Current Status:**
    *   The user has approved the plan.
    *   We were about to start creating the `Header.vue` component but were blocked by the workspace restriction.
    *   The user will now start a new session with full project access.
